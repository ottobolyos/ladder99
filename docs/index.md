# Ladder99 docs

## Rules

1. We use Nx monorepo.
2. We use `pnpm` package manager instead of `npm`. Although `npm` should work, we should prefer using `pnpm`.
3. In `docs/` everything should be linked in `docs/index.md`, either directly or indirectly.
4. Create unit tests for all relevant code, at least for all methods and functions.
5. Everything must be documented. Code should be documented with TSDoc, other stuff should be documented under `docs/` folder.
